### Project Title:

**codecademy-responsive-club-website**

### Project Description:

This is a website I created for a made up club called "Treasure Valley 3D". I wrote the code for this website while working through "Making a Website Responsive" 
section of the "Full-Stack Engineer" path on [CodeCademy.](https://www.codecademy.com/) The instructions for this assignment were to create a website for a local 
club (real or made up) that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen.

### Features:

As the screen size is changed, you will notice the following dynamic changes:
- Text Size Adjustment
- Image/Card Size Adjustment
- Image/Card Layout Changes
- Image Display Changes

The website is designed to be viewable on full size computer monitor screens all the way down to a small mobile screen of around 250 pixels.

Other features include a sticky Nav Bar and working page navigation links.

### Technologies:

I wrote the code for this website using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), saved the completed code to this GitHub repository, and published 
the site on [GitHub Pages](https://idmiller2020.github.io/codecademy-responsive-club-website/).

This website is written using HTML and CSS only.  The layout is accomplished using CSS Grid and Flexbox.  The dynamic responsive behavior is accomplished using a 
series of CSS @media rules.

### Current Loose Ends:

I'm not sure that I used the most efficient or easiest to follow approach to this assignment.  As I get more experience I'm hoping to be able to improve my code 
writing style.
